## Chapter 2

### Introduction
* Popularity of python for Machine learning is heavily driven by terrific amount of libaries available for developers.
  * Three of most popular are:
    * NumPy
      * Very efficient array and linear algebra functions
      * Free and open source
      * Widely used in the industry
      * The foundation on which other ML (Machine Learnign) libraries are built
    * scikit-learn.
      * Free and open source
      * Widely used in the industry
      * Implements many standard machine learning algorithms
    * pandas
      * Makes it easy to load and work with large data sets similar to a spreadsheet
      * Short for "panel data"

* No matter which supervised machine learning algorithm we use, the basic process will be the same.

### The basic workflow for training a supervised ML model

#### Step 1 : Get Data
#### Step 2 : Clean and Preprocess Data
#### Step 3 : Shuffle the Data
#### Step 4 : Split into Training/Test Data
#### Step 5 : Set Model Hyperparameters
* How fast to learn
* How complicated of a model to build
#### Step 6 : Train the Model
#### Step 7 : Evaluate the Model
#### Step 8 : Use the Model

### Gradient Boosting
* A machine learning algorithm that uses an ensemble of decision trees to predict values
* It can handle complex patterns and data that linear models can't handle.
* A decision tree is a model where you have branching decision points and you determine a final value by following a path through the tree.

* Option 1: Complex Decision Tree
* Option 2: Ensemble Learning
  * Combine the output of smaller decision trees
  *  Now, Instead of creating multiple decision trees that independently model the data, it creates decision trees that build on each other. The goal of each new tree is to fix the errors where the previous trees are the most wrong.
