## Chapter 4

#### Feature Engineering

* Using your own knowledge of the problem to choose features or create new features that allow machine learning algorithms to work more accurately


#### Why is Feature Engineering Needed?

* To get the best results from machine learning, you should only use features that correalte strongly with the output values

* Including useless features can harm the accuracy of the overall system

#### How? What?

1. Adding or dropping features
  * Choose the features that have the most signal
2. Combining multiple features into one feature
  * Represent the data in the simplest way possible
3. Binning
  * Replace an exact numerical measurement with a more broad category
4. One-hot encoding
  * A way to represent categorical data as numbers without creating

#### Curse of dimensionality
* As the number of dimensions (or features) in the data increases, the number of data points required to build a good model grows exponentially.
